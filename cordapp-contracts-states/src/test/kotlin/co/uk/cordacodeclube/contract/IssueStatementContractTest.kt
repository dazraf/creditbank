     * Task 1.
     * Recall that Commands are required to hint to the intention of the transaction as well as take a list of
     * public keys as parameters which correspond to the required signers for the transaction.
     * Commands also become more important later on when multiple actions are possible with an StatementState, e.g.
     * AddParticipant.
     * TODO: Add an "Issue" command to the StatementContract and check for the existence of the command in the verify
     * function.
     * Hint:
     * - For the create command we only care about the existence of it in a transaction, therefore it should subclass
     *   the [TypeOnlyCommandData] class.
     * - The command should be defined inside [StatementContract].
     * - You can use the [requireSingleCommand] function on [tx.commands] to check for the existence and type of the specified command
     *   in the transaction. [requireSingleCommand] requires a generic type to identify the type of command required.
     *
     *   requireSingleCommand<REQUIRED_COMMAND>()
     *
     * - We usually encapsulate our commands around an interface inside the contract class called [Commands] which
     *   implements the [CommandData] interface. The [Create] command itself should be defined inside the [Commands]
     *   interface as well as implement it, for example:
     *
     *     interface Commands : CommandData {
     *         class X : TypeOnlyCommandData(), Commands
     *     }
     *
     * - We can check for the existence of any command that implements [StatementContract.Commands] by using the
     *   [requireSingleCommand] function which takes a type parameter.

     * defined with your contract constraints. If not then the unit test will fail!

     * [StatementContract.verify].

     * Hint: You will nee da number of hints to complete this task!
     * - Use the Kotlin keyword 'val' to create a new constant which will hold a reference to the output Statement state.
     * - You can use the Kotlin function [single] to either grab the single element from the list or throw an exception
     *   if there are 0 or more than one elements in the list. Note that we have already checked the outputs list has
     *   only one element in the previous task.
     * - We need to obtain a reference to the proposed Statement for issuance from the [LedgerTransaction.outputs] list.
     *   This list is typed as a list of [ContractState]s, therefore we need to cast the [ContractState] which we return
     *   from [single] to an [StatementState]. You can use the Kotlin keyword 'as' to cast a class. E.g.
     *
     *       val state = tx.outputStates.single() as XState
     *
     * - When checking the [StatementState.amount] property is greater than zero, you need to check the

    /**
     * Task 5.
     * The list of public keys which the commands hold should contain all of the participants defined in the [StatementState].
     * This is because the Statement is a bilateral agreement where both parties involved are required to sign to issue an
     * Statement or change the properties of an existing Statement.
     * TODO: Add a contract constraint to check that all the required signers are [StatementState] participants.
     * Hint:
     * - In Kotlin you can perform a set equality check of two sets with the == operator.
     * - We need to check that the signers for the transaction are a subset of the participants list.
     * - We don't want any additional public keys not listed in the Statements participants list.
     * - You will need a reference to the Issue command to get access to the list of signers.
     * - [requireSingleCommand] returns the single required command - you can assign the return value to a constant.
     *
     * Kotlin Hints
     * Kotlin provides a map function for easy conversion of a [Collection] using map
     * - https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/map.html
     * [Collection] can be turned into a set using toSet()
